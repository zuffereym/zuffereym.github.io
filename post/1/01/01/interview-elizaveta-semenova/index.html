<p>Past April, Elizaveta Semenova  <a href="https://twitter.com/liza_p_semenova"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a><a href="https://www.swisstph.ch/en/staff/profile/people/elizaveta-semenova/"><i class="far fa-address-card"></i></a> gave an introduction to Bayesian inference in R, using <a href="http://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a>. In the meantime we had the chance to interview her.</p>

<h4 id="r-ladies-lausanne-can-you-tell-us-about-the-work-that-you-do">R-Ladies Lausanne: Can you tell us about the work that you do?</h4>

<p><u>Elizaveta Semenova</u>: Currently I am doing a PhD in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the <a href="https://www.swisstph.ch/en/">Swiss Tropical Institute of Public Health</a> where I develop novel models for analysis of surveillance data.
The disease that I look at specifically is malaria <em>at this stage of ???</em>.
There is a lot you need nowadays for new to analyse this type of data because it is very novel and historically there have been cases when malaria came to pretty low levels but once efforts were reduced those countries helped been in resurgence. And also there is big question when malaria comes to low levels.
What do you still need to do to absolutely knock it out to eradicate it.
This is not a trivial question.
So and my task is to provide some solid scientific answers to that based on statistical modelling.</p>

<h4 id="rll-from-what-countries-do-you-get-data">RLL: From what countries do you get data?</h4>

<p><u>ES</u>:I specifically work with data from Swaziland. This is very special country in terms of malaria. The highest burden of malaria world-wide is in sub-Saharan Africa.
I think 90 percent or 94 percent of cases as malaria are all in sub-Saharan Africa. But in sub-Saharan Africa there are countries with very different intensity levels. So some countries have very high malaria burden and incidence, while four countries are approaching elimination. And Swaziland is one of them and it is said to be the closest to elimination in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p>What is also very special about it, is that they have established a surveillance system capturing precise coordinates of each case. Meaning, for each malaria case they record the GPS coordinates of the household and the day when it occurred. Looking from our western perception at it, we may say that we have a lot of data of that type but in terms of malaria this is very unique.
And that&rsquo;s the first country in sub-Saharan Africa where we can get access to this type of data. That is the first time that you can actually analyse this very precise spatial temporal distribution of cases and gain more understanding of that process.</p>

<h4 id="rll-you-gave-a-presentation-on-bayesian-modeling-how-does-this-play-in-to-your-work">RLL: You gave a presentation on Bayesian modeling. How does this play in to your work?</h4>

<p><u>ES</u>: Stan is my absolute favourite tool for Bayesian inference. All the models I&rsquo;ve built during my PhD are centred around Bayesian inference and Bayesian statistics.
So I&rsquo;ve explored a lot of different tools for Bayesian inference with more readily available R packages or other historically popular software. But then at the end, once I discovered Stan, I realize that it works best for me. It was converges for some very specific likelihoods, which was problematic for the software that I tried before.</p>

<p>So with those other softwrae packages I would have never written the main paper that I am writing now. Since Stan has this very peculiar algorithm behind (Hamiltonian Monte Carlo), it is very efficient and very precise in the way it samples. So Stan is something that I think saved my PhD.</p>

<h4 id="rll-what-tools-to-you-use-at-work">RLL: What tools to you use at work?</h4>

<p><u>ES</u>: I only use R, for any data aquisition, data handling, data processing. For modeling I only use Stan. I prepare the data in R, then send it to Stan, get the output from Stan, and do post-processing in R.</p>

<h4 id="rll-before-asking-you-the-the-next-question-i-d-like-to-ask-about-your-educational-background-what-topics-did-you-study">RLL: Before asking you the the next question I&rsquo;d like to ask about your educational background. What topics did you study?</h4>

<p><u>ES</u>: <u>ES</u>: I studied theoretical mathematics. And I did my diploma (an analogy of a masters) in differential equations.</p>

<h4 id="rll-and-where-and-when-did-you-learn-r">RLL: And where and when did you learn R?</h4>

<p><u>ES</u>: When I when I started my PhD here in Basel. Because for my studies most things are done with just pen and paper. But I did encounter programming in school, when I was about 15 years old and was very fond of it. I got to know Pascal. And later Delphi and C++.</p>

<h4 id="rll-what-do-you-appreciate-most-in-r">RLL: What do you appreciate most in R?</h4>

<p><u>ES</u>: I think that simplicity and how easy it is to start. If you use R-Stuido as the environment, it is just so simple. If you in general understand how programming works, you do not need to do a lot of installations or set up environments like all this troubles with python for instance.</p>

<p>You do not need to think &ldquo;oh how do I run this command now from terminal?&rdquo;. And terminal of course terrifies that beginners. R has a much lower entrance threshold compared to any other tool that is used in statistics.</p>

<p>You can start from day one already writing functional programs.</p>

<h4 id="rll-what-would-you-like-to-learn-in-r">RLL: What would you like to learn in R?</h4>

<p><u>ES</u>: I have to confess that I never properly learn ggplot2 in a fluent way.</p>

<h4 id="rll-you-are-not-alone">RLL: You are not alone!</h4>

<p><u>ES</u>: But then, during my PhD I was focussing a lot on modelling and was was not keeping up with R development, libraries and productivity tools.</p>

<h4 id="rll-what-motivated-you-to-give-a-talk-at-r-ladies-lausanne">RLL: What motivated you to give a talk at R-Ladies Lausanne?</h4>

<p><u>ES</u>: I was very glad to talk about Baysian&rsquo;s statistics in general. I&rsquo;m quite passionate about it, but of course I am heavily biased given that this is what I do every day.</p>

<p>So we do not do any frequenters aanlysis and I think there is a lot of power in it in Bayesian stats.
But of course there is a very heavy entrance threshold because it is much harder to start with it as opposed to classical statistics. So I am always very happy to talk about the benefits of Bayesian statistics and how can you make it easy to work.</p>

<p>So I was very happy to talk about stan as exactly one of those tools. That can show you how easy and simple a model can look like.</p>

<p>So it is not rocket science to make Bayesian inference.</p>

<h4 id="rll-do-you-have-any-free-advertisement-for-a-not-for-profit-organisation-or-resource">RLL: Do you have any free advertisement for a not-for profit organisation or resource?</h4>

<p><u>ES</u>: I am part of <a href="https://www.womenplusplus.ch/">Women++</a>, an non-profit organization that aims to increase diversity in tech. After a recent <a href="http://hackandlead.com/">Hackathon</a>, we have now a summer break. But updates will be published on <a href="https://twitter.com/womenplusplus">Twitter</a>, Facebook and LinkedIn.</p>

<h4 id="rll-thank-you-for-taking-time-and-all-the-best-for-the-remaining-time-of-your-phd">RLL: Thank you for taking time and all the best for the remaining time of your PhD!</h4>
