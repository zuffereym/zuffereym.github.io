      <description>I feel that learning to program in R provided me with a mindset that helps me understand today&amp;rsquo;s technology much better.
 Rosalie Bruel  has a background in ecology research, where she just finished her PhD on lakes ecological response to climate change.
As one of our first supporters, she missed our lightening talk session in June as she will soon head to Vermont.
Luckily for us, she proposed to do a twitter thread instead on her work in environmental research.</description>
